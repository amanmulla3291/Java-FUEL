# **Step 1: Plan Your Architecture**

## Overview

- **Frontend (React):** The interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Backend (Hyperledger Fabric):** Blockchain to manage signing, verifying, and storing document data.
- **Database (Optional):** For non-critical data if needed.
- **Document Storage:** Use IPFS for decentralized storage if document data cannot reside on-chain.

---

## **Step 2: Set Up Your Development Environment**

### Install Prerequisites

1. **For React (Frontend):**
    - Node.js and npm: Download from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
    - A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

2. **For Hyperledger Fabric (Backend):**
    - Docker and Docker Compose: Install from [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
    - cURL and Git: For downloading and setting up Fabric.
    - Hyperledger Fabric binaries and Docker images: Follow the [official guide](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/).

3. **Optional:**
    - **IPFS**: Install IPFS Desktop or CLI for decentralized storage.

---

## **Step 3: Design User Roles and Features**

### User Roles

1. **Admin:**
    - Manage user accounts (create/approve/revoke).
    - Oversee documents and roles.
2. **Faculty/Staff:**
    - Sign, view, and verify documents.
3. **Students:**
    - Request and view signed documents.

### Features

- **Digital Signing:** Hash documents and store on blockchain.
- **Verification:** Compare document hash with blockchain-stored hash.
- **Document Requesting:** Securely request specific documents.
- **Role Management:** Role-based access control (RBAC).

---

## **Step 4: Set Up Hyperledger Fabric**

### Step-by-Step

1. **Download Hyperledger Fabric:**
    - Clone the Fabric samples repository:

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git
      cd fabric-samples
      ```

2. **Install Fabric Binaries and Docker Images:**
   Run the provided script in the `fabric-samples` folder:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up a Basic Network:**
   Use the `test-network` sample:

   ```bash
   cd test-network
   ./network.sh up createChannel -c mychannel -ca
   ```

4. **Deploy Chaincode (Smart Contract):**
    - Create chaincode for signing, verifying, and managing documents.
    - Deploy it to your channel:

      ```bash
      ./network.sh deployCC -ccn digitalSign -ccp ../chaincode/digitalSign -ccl javascript
      ```

5. **Test with CLI or Fabric SDK:**
   Use Fabric’s CLI or SDKs to interact with the blockchain network.

---

## **Step 5: Develop the Chaincode**

Write the smart contract (chaincode) for these operations:

- **Sign Documents:** Generate and store document hash with a signature.
- **Verify Documents:** Compare new hashes against stored hashes.
- **Request Documents:** Maintain request logs for admins and faculty.

Example (Node.js chaincode snippet):

```javascript
async signDocument(ctx, documentId, hash, signer) {
    const doc = { documentId, hash, signer, timestamp: new Date().toISOString() };
    await ctx.stub.putState(documentId, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(doc)));
    return `Document ${documentId} signed by ${signer}`;
}
```

---

## **Step 6: Develop the Frontend with React**

### Key Steps

1. **Initialize the React Project:**

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app digital-signature-system
   cd digital-signature-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Use libraries for UI and API communication:

   ```bash
   npm install axios react-router-dom material-ui
   ```

3. **Role-Based Dashboards:**
   Create separate views for Admin, Faculty, and Students.

4. **API Integration:**
    - Connect React with the Hyperledger Fabric backend using REST APIs.
    - Example API Call:

      ```javascript
      const signDocument = async (documentId, hash, signer) => {
          const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:4000/sign', { documentId, hash, signer });
          return response.data;
      };
      ```

5. **Responsive Design:**
   Use **Material-UI** or **Tailwind CSS** to make your app mobile-friendly.

---

## **Step 7: Integrate IPFS for Decentralized Document Storage (Optional)**

1. **Install IPFS:**
   Follow [IPFS installation guide](https://docs.ipfs.io/).

2. **Upload Documents:**
   Use the IPFS API to add a document and store its hash on-chain:

   ```javascript
   const ipfs = require('ipfs-http-client');
   const client = ipfs.create({ host: 'localhost', port: '5001', protocol: 'http' });

   const addDocument = async (file) => {
       const result = await client.add(file);
       return result.path; // Returns the IPFS hash
   };
   ```

3. **Retrieve Documents:**
   Access stored files using their IPFS hash.

---

## **Step 8: Test the Entire System**

1. **Setup Local Environment:**
    - Run Hyperledger Fabric locally using Docker.
    - Start your React app:

      ```bash
      npm start
      ```

2. **Test Features:**
    - Sign and verify documents as different roles.
    - Request documents and verify role-based access.

3. **Debug Issues:**
    - Use browser developer tools and Hyperledger logs for troubleshooting.

---

## **Step 9: Deploy the System**

1. **Frontend:**
    - Deploy the React app on **Netlify**, **Vercel**, or **GitHub Pages**.
    - Example command for GitHub Pages:

      ```bash
      npm run build
      npm install -g gh-pages
      gh-pages -d build
      ```

2. **Backend:**
    - Run Hyperledger Fabric on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS Free Tier, Google Cloud).

3. **Go Live:**
   Share the system with your college stakeholders and gather feedback.
